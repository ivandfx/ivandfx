- 👋 Hello, I'm Iván, I'm 17 y/o, although I'm mostly known as **ivandfx** :P
- 💻 I am currently studying Microcomputer Systems and Networks at the IES María Enríquez in Gandía, Valencia.
- 👌 Although my goal is not to be a programmer, far from it, I have a hobby of doing a bit of scripting, rather, learning, since I'm kind of a noob at this.
- 🤔 I don't usually make contributions beyond what I consider necessary for my projects.
- 👨‍💻 Currently developing [**DFX Tweaker**](https://github.com/ivandfx/DFXTweaker)
